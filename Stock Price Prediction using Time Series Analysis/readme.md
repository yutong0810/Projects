## Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Analysis

##### In this notebook, we aim to make predictions of stock prices, which will help investors gain more insight on the movement of the stock market and make profitable investments. We will be using the New York Stock Exchange dataset from Kaggle, provided by Dominik Gawlik. 

##### The data consist of four csv files, where the fundamental data and historical prices of S&P 500 companies are presented. We will only be using the prices data. Prices were fetched from Yahoo Finance, fundamentals are from Nasdaq Financials, extended by some fields from EDGAR SEC databases. 

##### We plan to use the technique of Machine learning to make the predictions. After splitting the data into train and test sets, we will use and neural networks to predict, and evaluate the performance by calculating net profit generated by our prediction or counting the frequency of large errors. We would also like to compare the performance of different models and find out the most accurate prediction.
